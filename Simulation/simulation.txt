##Simulation

Waveform Signals
read_data[7:0]: Data read from the slave.
received_addr[7:0]: Address received during communication.
write_data[7:0]: Data written to the slave.
ready: Indicates that the module is ready for the next operation.
state[3:0]: Current state of the FSM (Finite State Machine) controlling the I2C protocol.
i2c_clk: I2C clock signal generated for synchronous communication.
i2c_sda: Serial data line used for data transfer.
i2c_scl: Serial clock line for the protocol.
clk: System clock signal.
rst: Reset signal.
addr[6:0]: Address sent to the slave device.
data_in[7:0]: Input data provided for the write operation.
enable: Enables the I2C communication.
rw: Read/Write operation indicator (0 = write, 1 = read).
Key Operations
1. START Condition
Time Frame: Beginning (0 ns to 50 ns).
Details:
The i2c_sda line transitions from HIGH to LOW while i2c_scl is HIGH.
This indicates the start of communication.
FSM transitions to the next state (0001), indicating the start of address transmission.
2. Address Transmission
Time Frame: 50 ns to 100 ns.
Details:
The master sends a 7-bit address (0101010) on i2c_sda.
Each bit is synchronized with the clock signal i2c_scl.
The state transitions to 0010, indicating the process of sending the address.
Read/Write (W/R) Bit: At the end of the address, the rw bit (0) is transmitted to indicate a write operation.
3. Data Transmission
Time Frame: 100 ns to 200 ns.
Details:
The master sends 8 bits of data (11110111) on the i2c_sda line.
Data bits are sent one by one, synchronized with i2c_scl.
The FSM transitions to 0011, indicating data transmission.
ready signal may toggle depending on the state.
4. STOP Condition
Time Frame: Around 200 ns.
Details:
The i2c_sda line transitions from LOW to HIGH while i2c_scl is HIGH.
This indicates the end of communication.
The FSM transitions to 1000, indicating the stop condition.
State Transitions in FSM
0000 (Idle): The protocol is idle, waiting for a start condition.
0001 (Start Condition): Start condition detected; ready to send address.
0010 (Address Transmission): 7-bit address and W/R bit are transmitted.
0011 (Data Transmission): 8 bits of data are sent or received.
1000 (Stop Condition): Stop condition is detected; communication ends.
Important Observations
SDA and SCL Behavior:

Data (i2c_sda) changes only when the clock (i2c_scl) is LOW.
Data is stable when the clock is HIGH (I2C protocol requirement).
FSM State Progression:

The states progress logically based on the protocol phases (Start → Address → Data → Stop).
Waveform Accuracy:

The graph adheres to the I2C protocol specification and successfully demonstrates write operation.
